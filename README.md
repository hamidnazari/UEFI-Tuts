# Step by Step Tutorials on how to use the UEFI for OS Development from scratch

# NOTES  
- THE TUTORIALS ON YOUTUBE ARE WINDOWS BASED, BUT CODE SHOULD WORK IN LINUX AND MAC. 

- **UEFI 2.9 Specs PDF** : https://uefi.org/specifications  

- **WARNING** : The 40 meg file is still there, but for MAC users, the 256 meg file is in the ZIP inside of the HOLD folder. Windows users CAN use that size file too.  

- **The IMAGECREATOR program has been removed.**
